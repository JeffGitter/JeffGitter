# Thesis Online Framework

Welcome to the readme for your `online thesis`!
My name is `Jeff Jacobs`, game design professor at Luca School of Arts.
I created this template for our students to create their own online thesis and portfolio.

We started to feel that pure text documents got a bit outdated, especially for the medium of `Game Design`.
Students want to show off their work using video and audio, maybe even a playable build right here on their website!

To get started using the framework, follow along during our getting started lessons or take a look at the provided lesson materials.

# Al-folio

This framework is built off of al-folio, a great jekyll-based website template.
A lot of functionalities that are not needed for our use case have been removed to de-clutter the codebase and make everything a tiny bit neater.
New features were added that were specific to our use case, like the 3d Model viewer and the Unity WebGL build support.
We also provide a number of easy to use liquid blocks so our users can write content more easily without having to use HTML in their markdown documents.
